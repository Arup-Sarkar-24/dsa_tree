# DSA Basics

## Data vs. Information

- **Data**: Raw, unorganized facts  
  *Example:* `"30, John, $2000"`

- **Information**: Processed and organized data with context and meaning  
  *Example:* `"John, aged 30, earns $2000 monthly"`

## Q2) What is Data Structure?

- A way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
- Data structures define the layout of data in memory and help improve the performance of operations like searching, sorting, and inserting.
- **Examples**: Array, Linked List, Trees, Graph

## Q3) What is Algorithm?

- A finite sequence of well-defined instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.
- Algorithms are focused on optimizing **time** and **space**.
- **Examples**: Searching, Sorting

---

## Q4) What is Complexity?

- The main goal of DSA is to solve problems effectively and efficiently.
- To determine the efficiency of a program, we look at two types of complexities:

    - **Time Complexity**: How much time the code takes to run with respect to changes in input size.
    - **Space Complexity**: How much memory the code uses.

---

## Q5) What is Asymptotic Notation?

- Asymptotic notation is used to compare the efficiencies of algorithms.
- It's a mathematical tool that estimates time based on input size without running the code.
- It focuses on how many basic operations a program performs, giving insight into how the algorithm behaves as input size increases.

### Types of Asymptotic Notation:

- **Big  (O)**: Describes the **worst-case** scenario or the **upper bound** of performance.
- **Omega (Ω)**: Describes the **best-case** scenario or the **lower bound**.
- **Theta (θ)**: Describes the **average-case** scenario or general performance as input grows.

### BigO(1)- Constant Time
-** A**: No matter the size of the array, accessing any element takes a constant time(1 step).
